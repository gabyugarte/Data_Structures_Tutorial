### To find the middle element in a linked list:----------------------------------------------------------

#. Define the ListNode class
#The ListNode class represents each node in a linked list. It consists of a value (val) and a reference to the next node (next).
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

#The middleNode function aims to find the middle node of a linked list. It takes the head of the linked list as its argument.
def middleNode(head):
    # Initialize two pointers slow and fast
    slow = fast = head
    
    # Traverse the list with fast moving 2 steps and slow moving 1 step
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    # Return the node pointed to by slow (middle node)
    return slow

'''Walkthrough of the middleNode function:
Initialization of Pointers: slow and fast pointers are initialized to the head of the linked list (node1 in our example).
Traversing the List: The while loop advances fast by two steps and slow by one step in each iteration until fast reaches the end of the list or fast.next becomes None. This loop continues until fast is None or reaches the last node.
Finding the Middle Node: After the loop terminates, the position of the slow pointer indicates the middle of the linked list. In our example, slow will point to node 3, which is the middle node in the given linked list.
Returning the Middle Node: The function returns the node pointed to by slow, representing the middle node of the linked list.'''
